\section{Suggested algorithm}

Earlier work has given great consideration to parallellizing the join
operator. A related operator is top-k join. Top-k join returns an
ordered set of join results according to some provided function that
combines the orders on each input \cite{topkjoin}.

The top-k join operator should exploit orderings on each input, to
avoid doing extra work for each relation to be included. This
information is typically lost if the operator is implemented using an
unmodified join operator in combination with the sorting function.
This report tries to build on the work form \cite{topkjoin} by
parallelizing the algorithm using methods presented in
\ref{code-optimization} and \ref{sec:join-algorithms}. The
purpose is to create an efficient multi-core top-k join algorithm.
